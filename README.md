Stream API
==========

Stream Api is a  restfule backend for managing video stream information.  MongoDB needs to be running for the system to work.

The original Express front end no longer works properly and has been replaced with [VideoPipe](https://github.com/Surfincolin/videopipe).  Videopipe is an ember.js front end.
